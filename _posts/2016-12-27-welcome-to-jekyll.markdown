If you're here you've most likely been given a link or told to go here by Rune or Drake. If not... why are you here? This is a page we have mainly made just to flex coding skills and practice when we feel like it. You'll mostlikely be offended here so grab a seat, salt, and a napkin for tears.

A link to our social media can be found at the bottom of the <a href="https://tryhardrune.github.io/">Home page.</a>

Things we do:

{% highlight ruby %}
Various coding, simple things, just above your avarage skript kiddo.
Football in freetime, sometmes hardcore waterbottle flipping 
Sciencey shit
Being a meme lord.
Defenetly NOT hacking things, whats a hack? How do you do a hack?
Vidieo games and the occational phone game whilst shitting. 
{% endhighlight %}
